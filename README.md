a simple blog
# My-simple-blog
This is a simple blog website created using django, python, HTML, CSS, etc. I have created this project so that I can learn django. You can also contribute in this project if you want.   

You can just clone this repository by going to your folder location and type this command in terminal:  
 `git clone https://github.com/binamracode/My-simple-blog.git`  

After you clone the repository you must install all the required library given in the requirement.txt file. I recommend you to create virtual environment and install library with given version in requirement.txt file. You can also use the latest version if you want but some features may not work in future.  

After you clone repository and install all necessary things you can create new branch by the follow command in terminal for you:  
`git branch <your_branch_name>`  

Now, you can go that branch using this command:  
`git checkout <your_branch_name>`  

After that you can do lots of things to edit the repository. After you edit the files. You can type this command to add files in git:  
`git add *`  

After that type this following command to commit:  
`git commit -m "Your commit command"`  

And after that be sure you **forked** this repository and push that repository by using this command:  
`git push origin <your_branch_name>`  

Be sure that you must be in your branch while pushing.
You can also do the above things in GUI from above but that thing is little bit complicated. So, I gave this method.
